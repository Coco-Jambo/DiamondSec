## Goal
Hackers have many tools in their toolbelts that can help crack your passwords and expose your valuable data; ie. credit card information and/or private conversations. So it is essential for individuals on the internet to choose a password that is strong and can protect against popular, malicious password attacks. However, a good password can't help you against phishing attacks, and that is why anyone from an experienced software engineer to a grandmother who only checks her email should have a good understanding of the best practices for password creation and how to keep that password out of the hands of a hacker.

## The Approach
After brainstorming and blackboarding our initial concept and project idea, we decided how to implement it by weighing our various design options; (1) website or app, (2) back-end, front-end, or full-stack, and (3) desired languages, frameworks, and libraries. We determined that a front-end website written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript that can generate passwords through particular specs such as length and types of accepted characters (ie. numbers, special characters, and letters), as well as evaluating passwords given by the user, would a useful and simple tool for ensuring strong password use.

Dividing tasks amongst teammates, we were able to separate the website into parts using the Github repository; such as UI/UX designs, documentation, and programming the core password generation and analyzation processes in Javascript.

## Design and Prototype
Over the course of the last 24hrs, we built a design prototype of what the website will look like and how it would work. A video demonstration of it can be accessed on the [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/sustainu-app). Moreover, we also built a website which is directly hosted from this repository using Github Pages and can be accessed [here](https://kritgrover.github.io/htv-sustainu/). Here are a few snapshots of the app.

## Future Steps
As the cost of gas continues to fluctuate individuals are turning to use public transit. But, shouldn't they be rewarded for choosing this service and leaving a lower individual carbon footprint? <br>
<br>
We at SustainU think they do and thus we wish to open our app to the public and promote environmental sustainability with users across the GTA. An ambitious idea such as this would require cooperation and partnerships with both the private and public sectors. For example, a proposed idea is to have points gained through frequent use of public transport. In order to keep track of when a user uses a public transit service we'd have to partner up with PRESTO in order to link the transactions with the points system of SustainU. Another proposed idea is to partner up with the Municipal Governments in allowing points to be gained through the use of CityBikes. Furthermore, environmentally sustainable small businesses that wish to increase their brand exposure can partner with SustainU and provide offers and discounts on their products. 
Through SustainU individuals can finally be rewarded by being green.
